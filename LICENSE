GATMutPPI License
Copyright (c) 2025 Ross Stewart

This software can process protein complex structures from various sources. The applicable
license terms depend on the source of structural data used:

DUAL LICENSING STRUCTURE:

PATH A - WHEN USING ALPHAFOLD3 STRUCTURES (Non-Commercial Only):
If using AlphaFold3-generated structures, this software is subject to strict 
non-commercial restrictions. AlphaFold3 output is governed by Google DeepMind's 
AlphaFold3 Terms of Use, available at:
https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/OUTPUT_TERMS_OF_USE.md

Under Path A, the software may ONLY be used for non-commercial purposes by or on 
behalf of non-commercial organizations.

PATH B - WHEN USING OTHER STRUCTURES (MIT License):
If using experimentally-determined structures (e.g., from PDB) or other non-AlphaFold3
structural data, this software is licensed under the standard MIT License terms below.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

FOR PATH A (AlphaFold3 Structures) - NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY:

1. The Software may ONLY be used for non-commercial purposes by non-commercial 
   organizations (universities, non-profits, research institutes, educational 
   institutions, journalism bodies, and government bodies).

2. Commercial use is strictly prohibited, including:
   - Use by or on behalf of commercial organizations
   - Commercial research or development
   - Developing commercial products or services
   - Any use resulting in financial gain

3. Users must comply with AlphaFold3 Terms of Use, including:
   - Not using AlphaFold3 output for commercial activities
   - Not training competing structure prediction models
   - Properly attributing AlphaFold3 in publications

FOR PATH B (Non-AlphaFold3 Structures) - MIT LICENSE:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

COMMON REQUIREMENTS (Both Paths):

1. ATTRIBUTION: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be 
   included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Any publication 
   or presentation of results obtained using this Software must cite:
   "Predicting interaction-specific protein–protein interaction perturbations by 
   missense variants with GATMutPPI" by Ross Stewart et al.

2. STRUCTURE SOURCE DECLARATION: Users must clearly document and maintain records 
   of the source of structural data used (AlphaFold3 vs. experimental/other).

3. NO WARRANTY: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
   AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
   OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
   SOFTWARE.

4. USER RESPONSIBILITY: Users are solely responsible for:
   - Determining which license path applies to their use case
   - Ensuring compliance with applicable structural data licenses
   - Maintaining proper documentation of structure sources
   - Obtaining appropriate rights for their intended use

5. TERMINATION: This license automatically terminates if you:
   - Violate any terms of this license
   - Use AlphaFold3 structures under Path B terms
   - Misrepresent the source of structural data
   - Violate the AlphaFold3 Terms of Use when using AlphaFold3 output

---

IMPORTANT: The license path is determined by the SOURCE of structural data, not 
user preference. Using any AlphaFold3-generated structures automatically invokes 
Path A restrictions for that usage.
